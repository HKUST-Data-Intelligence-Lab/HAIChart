# HAIChart
HAIChart is a system based on reinforcement learning that integrates human insights and AI capabilities for improved visualizations.

## Directory Structure

- **datasets/**: This directory contains the datasets utilized in this project, including the VizML dataset and KaggleBench. These datasets are foundational to the training and evaluation of the HAIChart system.

- **static/**: Houses the static web resources employed by this project. These resources are essential for the rendering and functionality of the web-based interface of HAIChart.

- **templates/**: Contains the source code for the front-end interactive interface. This interface is crucial for enabling users to interact with the HAIChart system, providing a user-friendly platform for data visualization.

- **tools/**: This folder stores various components that organize and facilitate the functionality of the project. It includes scripts such as `features.py` and `instance.py`, among others, that are pivotal for the system's operation.

- **user_model/**: Stores the implementation code for the user model, including `discriminator.py`, `agent.py`, and more. The user model is integral to tailoring the HAIChart system's outputs to the preferences and requirements of the user.

- **mcgs.py**: Implements the visualization generation and recommendation based on Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS). This script is central to the HAIChart system's ability to generate and recommend data visualizations in an efficient and effective manner.
